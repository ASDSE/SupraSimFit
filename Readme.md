# Molecular Binding Assay Fitting Toolkit

A Python-based application for analyzing molecular binding interactions using various spectroscopic assays. This tool provides robust mathematical fitting algorithms based on **forward modeling** approaches that overcome limitations of traditional data transformation methods commonly used in supramolecular chemistry and biochemistry.

## 🧬 Overview

### Forward Modeling Approach

Unlike traditional binding analysis methods that rely on data transformation (Scatchard plots, Hill plots, double-reciprocal plots), this application employs **direct forward modeling** where theoretical binding curves are fitted directly to raw experimental data. This approach offers several key advantages:

- **Preserves Error Structure**: Maintains native measurement uncertainties without distortion from data transformation
- **Physical Constraints**: Parameters are bounded by thermodynamically reasonable values, ensuring physically meaningful results
- **Handles Complex Systems**: Naturally accommodates competitive binding and ligand depletion scenarios
- **Robust Validation**: Model assessment occurs in the original measurement space where experimental errors are best understood

### Supported Assay Types

This application enables analysis of experimental data from various spectroscopic assays:

- **GDA (Guest Displacement Assay)**: Quantifies guest binding affinity by monitoring displacement of a preformed host-indicator complex - particularly valuable for spectroscopically silent hosts and guests, and superior for insoluble or weakly binding guests
- **IDA (Indicator Displacement Assay)**: Determines binding constants using competitive displacement of indicator dyes - enables detection in complex biological matrices through ultra-high-affinity reporter pairs
- **DBA (Direct Binding Assay)**: Direct measurement of host-guest or dye-host binding interactions available in both titration modes - monitors spectroscopic changes upon complex formation but limited in complex matrices due to competitive binding from naturally occurring interferents
- **Dye Alone**: Linear calibration fitting for indicator dyes - establishes baseline fluorescence properties and corrects for inner filter effects in competitive binding assays

The application features an intuitive Tkinter-based graphical user interface with advanced data visualization, comprehensive statistical analysis, and flexible result export capabilities. 

## 🚀 Features

### Core Analysis Capabilities
- **Multiple Assay Types**: Support for GDA, IDA, DBA (both host-to-dye and dye-to-host titrations), and dye alone calibration
- **Advanced Optimization**: L-BFGS-B constrained optimization with multi-start global optimization for robust parameter estimation
- **Ensemble-Based Uncertainty**: Parameter uncertainties estimated through ensemble statistics from multiple optimization runs, capturing nonlinear uncertainty propagation
- **Physical Constraints**: Thermodynamically bounded parameters ensure meaningful binding constants and fluorescence coefficients

### Statistical Analysis & Quality Control
- **Multi-Level Quality Assessment**: R²/RMSE filtering with adaptive thresholds and parameter ensemble validation
- **Robust Parameter Estimation**: Median-based statistics from optimization ensembles provide outlier-resistant results
- **Comprehensive Error Analysis**: Confidence intervals that account for both optimization uncertainty and experimental variability
- **Model Validation**: Goodness-of-fit metrics and residual analysis in the original measurement space

### Data Processing & Visualization
- **Data Visualization**: Publication-quality plots with unified styling and export options
- **Result Merging**: Statistical combination of multiple fitting results with outlier detection using median absolute deviation criteria
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux with automated build system

## 🔬 Scientific Background

### Binding Models

The application implements rigorous binding models based on mass action kinetics and equilibrium thermodynamics:

#### Direct Binding Assay (DBA)

DBA measures direct binding interactions through spectroscopic signal changes upon complex formation.

**Equilibrium:**
```
Host + Dye ⇌ Host-Dye Complex
Ka = [Host-Dye] / ([Host][Dye])
```

**Signal Equation:**
```
I = I₀ + I_dye × [Dye] + I_complex × [Host-Dye]
```

Where I₀ is baseline fluorescence, and I_dye, I_complex are molar fluorescence coefficients.

#### Competitive Binding Assays (IDA & GDA)

These assays involve coupled equilibria where two species compete for the same binding site.

**Equilibria:**
```
Host + Dye ⇌ Host-Dye     (Ka_dye)
Host + Guest ⇌ Host-Guest (Ka_guest)  
```

The mathematical framework handles the coupled mass balance equations numerically, accounting for competitive displacement based on relative binding affinities.

### Key Methodological Advances

- **Forward Modeling**: Direct fitting of binding equations to raw data, avoiding transformation artifacts
- **Physical Constraints**: Binding constants bounded by thermodynamically reasonable ranges (10² to 10¹⁰ M⁻¹)
